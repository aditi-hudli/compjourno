## Housing in the Bronx 

“When I was pregnant with my second child, my husband and I had to defecate into plasticbags.” says Carla Votor, 45. She has been living at St. Edmund's Court, 1892 Morris Avenue for over 20 years. She says, “I used to sleep in front of the oven with my baby”. This is the first time in 20 years that she's had proper heating for the winter.

St. Edmund’s Court at 1892 Morris Avenue, Bronx is listed as the worst building in the Bronx, according to the landlord watchlist. Each year since 2010 the public advocate's office releases the list of 100 worst landlord's in New York City. 

The list is based on HPD violations. When a tenant calls 311 to complain about the state of the apartment, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development(HPD) marks it as a violation against the building.     

St.Edmund’s Court is a public housing building, it is meant for low income housing under Section 8. Mount Hope Housing Co Inc, is a non for profit organization that attempts to match the people in need with a home. They own 1892 Morris Ave along with 30 other buildings in the Bronx. Out of these 11 are public housing buildings. 

Radiance Brown, 69, a board member of the organization says, “we can’t tell people how to live.” She believes that despite attempts by the management to clean up the building, it is ultimately upon the tenants to keep a clean and neat home. Brown continued that, some of the residents need to be taught proper hygiene practices as some many not be used to it. 

"The tiles around the bath tub were all falling out, exposing the apartment wall. I don't think cleaning the tiles would have helped", says Karl Nemeth, 35, Carla's husband of three years. Nemeth explained that there are structural problems in the apartment like broken heaters, missing ventilation, broken windows, etc which can not be chalked up to cleanliness.

In agreement with Brown, Jemel Allah, 64, property/field manager, pointed out a document which showed that as of March 2017, there were over 685 violations. However, as of November 1, there were only 245 or so. "We are doing the work. We want to do the work, but the tenants have to let us in to do the work." 

Allah believes that there are still some violations because the tenants would not let him and his workers into the apartment to do the repairs. He explained that another reason that the building is still on the list is that,the HPD hasn’t removed old violations that were dealt with. 

Votor said that some of the residents were wary to let the management into the apartment because of the class action against the company In March, 2017, the residents organized and went to court against the management company. Votor alledges that Allah and others started repairs only after the company was brought to court. 

Allah is confident that if the tenant would fill out complaint forms at the office rather than calling 311, the number of violations would be lower. He clarifies that it is the tenant's perrogative who they wish to call, but it results in unecessary violations against the buildings.

Akili Edwards, 26, a resident of 54 East Walton Avenue, has on kind words for the management. "The ceiling leaks, the tiles are broken, there's hardly no heating.They half-ass everything", says Edwards. His building is not public housing, he owns his apartment. Every winter he calls 311 about the heating but to no avail. He has complained to Allah about the heat but when nothing is done for weeks he or his mother call 311. 

Edwards explained that the management ignores some buildings for some years, and if the residents threaten legal action then work gets done. 

Allah, pleased with the work being done says, "Some residents are happy with the work being done. Some residents just liek to cause trouble and blame the management." He believes that, 1892 Morris Avenue will not be on the watchlist for another year.
